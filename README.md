# ESP8266-BME280-Blynk-DeepSleepMode

This project is the environment telemetry project using ESP8266 in deep sleep mode and BME280.<br>
-Connecting ESP8266 to Wi-Fi Network.<br>
-Sensing Temprature,Humidity,Pressure By BME280 made by Bosch<br>
-Sending Sensed data to Blynk server through Wi-Fi Network<br>
-Dive to deep sleep mode<br>
-Visualizing those infrmation by Blynk<br>
-Using Blynk client Apps on Arduino, you can find those environment data.<br>
